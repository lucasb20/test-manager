## Description

Test Manager is a test management system that allows you to create, organize, execute, and track software test cases. Its focus is to replace scattered spreadsheets and documents with a centralized platform.

Using generic tools like spreadsheets and documents to manage software testing is inefficient. This leads to problems like disorganization, lack of traceability, limited collaboration, and ineffective reporting.

The system will centralize test management, increasing the efficiency of QA teams. This will lead to improved software quality, reduced bugs in production, and accelerated development cycles, allowing teams to focus on creating, not managing, documents.

## System Requirements

The server environment should consist of:
- web-server: Nginx 1.13.x
- Python > 3.12
- DBMS
  - MySQL x.x.x
  - MariaDB 10.x
  - Postgres x.x

Tested on web browsers:
- Firefox
- Chrome

## Installation

1. Good luck.
